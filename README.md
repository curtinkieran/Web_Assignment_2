# Web_Assignment_2
Project demonstrating HTMLCSS &amp; JavaScript

In this second web application module assignment, I am primarily focusing on JavaScript and interacting with a JSON file.

Note the use of a static JSON file.
We are not making an API request, as last year the hosting website blocked users from my university due to excessive requests!

(work with RESTful APIs is demonstrated in my work on the "Dublin Bikes" project repo - currently private)
